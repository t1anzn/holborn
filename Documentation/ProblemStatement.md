# Problem Statement

## Context and Problem
In 10 years time, London will undergo extreme changes in almost every aspect. Tourists of the future may want to educate
themselves on the societal, environmental, and technological changes to better understand how London developed into the
city it'll be in 2034. What has transformed, what remained unchanged, what were the anticipated changes compared to actual
change, how people have changed, and even the cultural and social changes. 

Resources providing information that explores not only the current time, but the past too, are harder to find. Tourists may want to see the changes and also what to look out for based on historical trends and developments, for example, tourist sites and growing areas.

Our website will be set in the future as if 2034 is present day, and it will feature all the most important information regarding Holborn that any tourists will want to know.

## Objective

We aim to create a speculative website for future tourists to explore London in 2034 with ease and fun. It will cover,

- Trends: Possible changes that can be anticipated through trends in the past years.
- Places: What has changed, why it changed, what hasn't changed, why it hasn't changed.
- People/Stories: Narratives that imagine the evolution of London.
