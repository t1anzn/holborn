## Page colour scheme
Team discussed what colour scheme would best bring visitors to the site in an engaging and attractive way. The dark base establishes a clean, modern and professional look, while the blue accent colors are strategically used to draw attention to key elements such as call-to-action buttons, navigation links, and interactive features. By prioritizing accessibility, the color scheme incorporates sufficient contrast ratios to ensure all content is easily readable for users.

## Page layouts
The team brainstormed ideas for the Figma prototypes and organized the webpage images, page copy and ensuring a seamless visual narrative throughout the site. We focused on creating intuitive and user-friendly layouts that guide visitors effortlessly through the content. Each section was planned to maintain consistency, with clearly defined headers, balanced white space, and responsive elements to adapt to various screen sizes.

Interactive features, such as image carousels, on-scroll and hover animations, were incorporated to enhance engagement, while maintaining a minimalist design aesthetic. The layouts were designed to prioritize readability and functionality, ensuring users can quickly find the information they need while enjoying a visually appealing experience.

## Featured stories, trends etc
The team collaborated to determine the most compelling/important events and trends to showcase, strategically placing them to capture users' attention and encourage exploration. For example, the image carousel would feature the most important and trending stories on the main page to catch the user's eye, encouraging them to explore the rest of the site.

Each featured story or trend was assigned a dedicated carousel section on the site, tailored to be highlighted to visitors. Careful thought was given to the layout, with vibrant imagery, concise descriptions, and intuitive navigation. This approach ensures that users can easily browse through content that sparks their curiosity while seamlessly transitioning between pages for a cohesive experience.

## Article content
The team discussed and planned the type of content to include in each article, ensuring that the design and layout aligns with the website's overall theme. We focused on creating informative, readible, and visually appealing articles that provide value to visitors while maintaining a consistent tone and style.

Victor, leveraging his thorough research, worked to populate these articles with speculative but realistic information. Each article's layout was carefully designed to enhance readability, with a balance of text, images, and interactive elements. This approach ensures that users remain engaged while navigating through the easily readible content.
